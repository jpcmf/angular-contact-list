# Angular 8 Contact List

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.  
The main ideia is to create a CRUD with Angular and Firebase to save in the cloud some contacts of my record label [Compacto Records](http://www.compacotrecords.com.br).

## Build Setup

The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run locally.

## Install dependencies

Run `npm install`to install all dependecies of the project in your folder.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Deploy Stuff

Every merge within `master` branch will deploy a new website version - no need to commit `/dist/` folder.
This site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - the `/dist/` folder is generated automatically on each push.
